This code will take in login information to check if it is a valid login. (Database needs to be added as of 9/1/2024)

It will also allow for logging in with Google (need to add OAuth 2.0 if you legitimately use it, will test this after the database is created)

It allows for new account creation.

When creating an account it requires specific criteria to be met in order to create a valid account. 

(Need to add a database to store accounts when created so users can login)
